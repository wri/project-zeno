    Use this dataset to show recent vegetation changes across all ecosystems, measured in hectares (ha).
    Show classified alerts (LDACS) by default, which is designed to reveal likely causes of disturbance,
    identify dominant drivers in a region, and support ecosystem or regional comparisons.
    LDACS is updated quarterly and covers the most recent 12 months, so classification data are not
    available for the last 90 days.
    Clarify whether the user cares about temporary disturbance or permanent conversion; recommend
    annual land cover or tree cover loss datasets for historical or long-term changes.
    For recent trends, show alert counts over time using line charts.
    Use pie charts to show the distribution of disturbed area by specific driver.
    Use pie charts to show the distribution of disturbed area by land cover class or natural land type to show which ecosystems
    are most affected.
    Use grouped bar charts with alert date (month) on the x-axis, area in hectares on the y-axis,
    and class name to differentiate bars, highlighting seasonal patterns.
    Plot drivers separately if one dominates (makes up > 80% of alerts in any given month) and decide
    whether to include or exclude unclassified alerts based on whether the goal is to highlight only
    known drivers or completeness.
    Potential conversion requires ≥75 days of sustained loss, so recent clearing may not appear;
    conversion may also be undercounted when fire is used for clearing or when it occurs near rivers.
    Severe boreal fires may be misclassified as conversion. Always interpret alerts as indicators,
    not definitive outcomes.

    Global All Ecosystem Disturbance Alerts (DIST-ALERT) provides near-real-time alerts
    of vegetation disturbance globally at 30-meter resolution, using harmonized
    Landsat-Sentinel-2 imagery. A filtered subset of these daily alerts (Land Disturbance Alert
    Classification System or LDACS) can also be classified into potential drivers:
    conversion, cropland dynamics, fire-related, water-related, or unclassified.
    Users are informed about significant changes to the vegetation, which can indicate human
    induced changes such as deforestation, as well as drought and other events where actions
    by land managers may be required.
    Crucially, this dataset covers all vegetation, not just forest, so that new
    non-conversion of natural ecosystems commitments can be monitored.
  methodology: >
    This dataset is a derivative of the OPERA's DIST-ALERT product (OPERA Land Surface
    Disturbance Alert from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 product), which is derived
    through a time-series analysis of harmonized data from the NASA/USGS Landsat and
    ESA Sentinel-2 satellites (known as the HLS dataset). The product identifies and
    continuously monitors vegetation cover change in 30-m pixels across the globe. It
    can be accessed through the LPDAAC website here: [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=C2746980408-LPCLOUD),
    and on Google Earth Engine (GEE) as an Image Collection with asset ID:
    projects/glad/HLSDIST/current/[Insert Layer Name].

    The DIST-ALERT on GFW is a derivative of this, and additional data layers not used
    in the GFW product are available through the LPDAAC and GEE such as initial
    vegetation fraction, and disturbance duration. While the version on the LPDAAC is
    updated every 2-4 days, the data is updated weekly on GFW. The product detects
    notable reductions in vegetation cover (measured as "vegetation fraction" or the
    percent of the ground that is covered by vegetation) for every pixel every time
    the new satellite data is acquired and the ground is not obscured by clouds or snow.

    The current vegetation fraction estimate is compared to the minimum fraction for
    the same time period (within 15 days before and after) in the previous 3 years,
    and if there is a reduction, then the system identifies an alert in that pixel.
    Anomalies of at least a 10% reduction from the minimum become alerts in the
    original product, and on GFW, a higher threshold of 30% is used, to reduce noise,
    and false alerts in the dataset. Because the product compares each pixel to the
    minimum for the same time period in previous years, it takes into account regular
    seasonal variation in vegetation cover. As the product is global and detects
    vegetation anomalies, much of the data may not be applicable to GFW users
    monitoring forests. Therefore, we also offer the option to mask the alerts with
    UMD's tree cover map, allowing users to view only alerts within 30% canopy cover.
  cautions: >
    These alerts detect vegetation cover loss or disturbance. This product does not
    distinguish between human-caused and other disturbance types. For example, where
    alerts are detected within plantation forests, alerts may indicate timber harvesting
    operations, without a conversion to a non-forest land use, and when alerts are
    detected within crop land, alerts may represent crop harvesting.

    We do not recommend using the alerts for global or regional trend assessment, nor
    for area estimates. Rather, we recommend using the annual tree cover loss data for
    a more accurate comparison of the trends in forest change over time, and for area
    estimates. For global land cover changes, [20 year data](https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/GLCLUC2020)
    may be more useful for certain purposes and should be explored. Additionally,
    updates to the methodologies and variation in cloud cover between months and years
    pose additional risks to using alerts for inter/intra-annual comparison.

    The alerts can be 'curated' to identify those alerts of interest to a user, such
    as those alerts which are likely to be deforestation and might be prioritized for
    action. A user can do this by overlaying other contextual datasets, such as
    protected areas, or planted trees. The non-curated data are provided here in order
    that users can define their own prioritization approaches. Curated alert locations
    within tree cover are provided in the Places to Watch data layer.

    We provide a masked version of the product within "tree cover" which is defined as
    all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height (2020) with greater than 30% canopy
    cover (2010), and may take the form of natural forests or plantations. Annual tree
    cover loss from 2021 is masked out.

    In contrast to other alert systems available on GFW, DIST-ALERT continues to
    monitor pixels where it has identified an alert in the past. The DIST-ALERT
    retains the date of the most recent detection of disturbance, keeping users
    informed of the most up-to-date changes within tree cover.

    Two confidence levels are provided. The approach determines confidence level by the
    number of anomalous observations, with more observations meaning a higher
    confidence level. That is, two to three anomalies detected result in a low
    confidence alert, whereas four or more mean a high confidence alert. UMD's Google
    Earth Engine app [DIST-ALERT](https://glad.earthengine.app/view/dist-alert)
    displays alerts, with a different approach used to define confidence, and a
    different threshold for the vegetation reduction which triggers alerts.

    This datset contains land-cover class snapshots in 2015 and 2024, reporting
    pixel-level class changes, measured in hectares (ha).
    For change questions, use tables with land_cover_class_start,
    land_cover_class_end, and area_ha columns to show transitions. Warn users that
    the data only shows start- and end-states, not intra-annual changes. Clarify
    that this is not an annual time series or intra-annual product. Warn users that
    this data does not capture classes that remained the same between 2015 and 2024.
    For composition questions, use pie-charts to show the area of each land cover
    class in 2024, and for ONLY 2024.
    Drop zeros. Transitions to "short vegetation" or "bare" may reflect seasonality,
    not restoration/degradation. When users ask about agriculture,
    combine "cropland"+"cultivated grassland" unless they specify otherwise.

    This Global Land Cover dataset is a combination of two global datasets: the GLAD Land
    Cover and Land Use Change annual data and the Global Pasture Watch Grassland Class
    Collection 2 Cultivated Grasslands annual data. This combination is annual from 2015
    through 2024. This dataset shows land covers and uses including: bare ground and sparse
    vegetation, short vegetation, tree cover, wetlands, water, snow/ice, cropland,
    cultivated grasslands, and built-up land.
  methodology: >
    This Global Land Cover time series was created by combining annual GLAD Land Cover and
    Land Use Change data from the UMD GLAD lab with annual Cultivated Grassland data from
    the Global Pasture Watch consortium.

    The GLAD Land Cover and Land Use Change data is a combination of separate supervised
    classification models for each of the major thematic classes. The models were run on
    Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) and were calibrated locally or regionally. Each class
    was validated with a statistical sample analysis. The forest height, cropland, snow/ice,
    built-up, and water were combined with a vegetation fraction layer with a specific
    hierarchy in order to create the combined land cover map for each year. A wetland layer
    was overlaid onto the data in forest and short vegetation areas. Because of the
    continuous nature of the vegetation fraction, forest height, and water classes, we
    re-classified the values into eight classes: bare ground & sparse vegetation (<20%
    vegetation fraction), short vegetation (>=20% vegetation fraction <5m in height), tree
    cover (>=5m in height), wetland short vegetation, water (20-100% of the year), snow &
    ice, cropland, and built-up. Each land cover was validated separately with overall
    accuracies as follows: Forest extent in 2020: 97.2% (0.7 s.e.), Cropland extent in
    2016-2019: 97.2%(0.3 s.e.), Snow/Ice extent in 2020: 99.8% (0.04 s.e.). There was also
    validation done for the changes over time for each class, available in the full paper.

    The Cultivated Grasslands layer from Global Pasture Watch, which shows the spatiotemporal
    distribution of cultivated and natural/semi-natural grassland classes, was produced by
    using GLAD Landsat ARD-2 image archive, accompanied by climatic, landform and proximity
    covariates, spatiotemporal machine learning (per-class Random Forest) and over 2.3 M
    reference samples (visually interpreted in Very High Resolution imagery). Custom
    probability thresholds (based on five-fold spatial cross-validation) were used to derive
    dominant class maps with balanced user's and producer's accuracy, resulting in f1 score
    of 0.64 and 0.75 for cultivated and natural/semi-natural grassland, respectively.

    The areas with a probability over 42% for natural/semi-natural grasslands and 38% for
    cultivated grasslands were combined into a dominant map where the natural/semi-natural
    class has priority. Cultivated Grassland pixels from the dominant class map were
    isolated and inserted into the short vegetation and wetland classes in the GLAD data as
    an eighth class.
  cautions: >
    This dataset represents land covers and some land uses, but when calculating areas of
    change, it should be noted that it shows land cover change, not necessarily land use
    change. It also does not represent conversion, a concept defined by the Accountability
    Framework initiative. Caution should be used if using this land cover change data over
    the full time period since it does not capture all the changes in the time series, only
    what the pixels were in 2015 and 2024.

    Transitions between the 'bare ground & sparse vegetation' and 'short vegetation' or
    'wetland short vegetation' classes can be due to precipitation patterns or minor changes
    in vegetation cover and are not necessarily large changes in vegetation cover or
    degradation.

    If a user asks about tree cover loss due to another land cover, zeno should answer with
    both an area of TCL due to a certain driver (TCL grouped by a specific driver) and
    percent of loss that was due to that driver, NOT with the land cover change areas from
    this product.

    Land cover transitions to vegetation are not necessarily restoration. Users should
    exercise caution if using this data at the local scale. We encourage ground-truthing
    data if using this for decision-making. Data not suitable for within year dynamics like
    crop cycles and flood pulses.
  function_usage_notes: >
    This Global Land Cover dataset is intended to be used for monitoring land cover in
    individual years as well as change over time. Note that changes over time indicate land
    cover changes and may or may not capture land use changes.

    This dataset should be used when a user asks about area in a specific year or gain or
    loss of area between years for bare ground and sparse vegetation, short vegetation,
    wetlands, water, snow/ice, cropland, cultivated grasslands, and built-up land. Gain of
    tree cover can be derived from this dataset. Never use this dataset for tree cover loss,
    instead refer to the Tree Cover Loss (Hansen/UMD/GLAD) data. This dataset may be
    overlaid with DIST alert data to find alerts in specific land covers. It can also be
    used to find where land cover has changed since 2020 and then overlaid with the Natural
    Lands map to identify land cover changes on land that was natural in 2020.

    If a user asks for world area under agricultural use, Zeno should combine cropland +
    cultivated grassland or it should ask user to clarify which one they are interested in
    or if they want both combined.

    Gain in natural/semi-natural grassland can mean any of the following: restoration, regeneration,
    land abandonment, early successional stages, regrowth may be dominated by invasive species or
    woody plant encroachment, temporary states rather than restored ecosystems.
    Loss from natural/semi-natural grasslands can mean any of the following: permanent (or
    semi-permanent) transition to another land cover or land use, natural vegetation dynamics,
    such as regrowth following disturbance, natural seasonal or interannual variability, such as
    floodplain inundation, for example.

    Annual 30 m maps of global natural/semi-natural grassland extent from 2000 to 2022.
    This dataset defines grasslands very broadly such that they encompass grasslands, shrublands,
    and savannas by including any land cover type which contains at least 30% of dry or wet
    low vegetation, dominated by grasses and forbs (less than 3 meters) and a:
      maximum of 50% tree canopy cover (greater than 5 meters),
      maximum of 70% of other woody vegetation (scrubs and open shrubland), and
      maximum of 50% active cropland cover in mosaic landscapes of cropland & other vegetation.
    Natural/semi-natural grassland: Relatively undisturbed native grasslands/short-height vegetation,
    such as steppes and tundra, as well as areas that have experienced varying degrees of human
    activity in the past, which may contain a mix of native and introduced species due to
    historical land use and natural processes. In general, they exhibit natural-looking patterns
    of varied vegetation and clearly ordered hydrological relationships throughout the landscape.
  methodology: >
    The dataset showing the spatiotemporal distribution of natural/semi-natural
    grassland classes was produced by using GLAD Landsat ARD-2 image archive, accompanied by
    climatic, landform and proximity covariates, spatiotemporal machine learning (per-class
    Random Forest) and over 2.3 M reference samples (visually interpreted in Very High
    Resolution imagery). Custom probability thresholds (based on five-fold spatial
    cross-validation) were used to derive dominant class maps with balanced user's and
    producer's accuracy, resulting in f1 score of 0.75 for natural/semi-natural grassland.
  cautions: >
    Despite the flexibility provided by the probability maps, we note several classification
    issues and limitation in our natural/semi-natural grassland predictions (see Table 6).
    Most of these issues (e.g. specially the miss-classification errors) are not trivial to
    resolve in the face of Random Forest as a complex and non-linear prediction system, as we
    are not sure these outcomes happen because of (1) extrapolation problems, (2) noise/limited
    detectability in the Landsat images, (3) fuzzy definition of grassland classes, (4) need
    of more specialized and regional/local ML models, or (5) simply a lack of training points
    in these areas.
    It appears that intensively managed grasslands, with high homogeneity under many conditions,
    have a high chance of being confused with other classes that have very similar spectral
    properties, such as urban mosaics (i.e. buildings, sparse trees and grass fields with
    different densities) or (greenish) croplands with similar vegetation height and spatial
    configuration (such as cereal crops). Less intensively cultivated grasslands, where more
    diverse plant species can be found and where the landscape may not be very regular, are
    easily confused with grasslands that are not cultivated or (semi) natural herbaceous
    vegetation, in general. In addition, the spectral signal of cultivated grasslands can not
    be as clearly distinguished from natural/semi-natural grassland as it could be from
    croplands, where there are clear breaks in vegetation growth in cases where multi-temporal
    clear-sky images are available.
    The distinction between cultivated and natural/semi-natural grasslands has been notoriously
    difficult to map in the past, which has also affected our reference data collection and
    harmonization process. Hence, our reference labeling protocol relied on more indirect
    indicators of management, such as fences and other typical infrastructure, hay bales,
    machine presence, and even animal presence in the field or geometric shapes of the landscape.
    This may lead to an underestimation of signs of cultivation that may be less intensive or
    where VHR imagery was not available at the time of management practices.
    Under-estimation of grassland extent
      Grassland extent is under-predicted in southeastern Africa (mainly in Zimbabwe and Mozambique)
      and in eastern Australia (mainly in the shrublands and woodlands of the Mulga ecoregion).
    Cropland misclassified as grassland
      In the state of Montana, USA, cropland areas located on historical prairie areas have high
      probability values for natural/semi-natural grassland and low values for cultivated grassland.
      Sudan, Niger, Uganda, Kenya, and Mali have several cropland areas with high probability
      values for natural/semi-natural grassland.
    Mixed farmland mosaics misclassified as grassland
      Farmland mosaics in North-Eastern Uganda's present high probability for both grassland classes,
    Macroscopic errors
      Although important for grassland separation, the 1-km accessibility maps and MODIS products
      (MOD11A2 and MCD19A2) introduced curvilinear macroscopic errors (due to the downscaling
      strategy based on cubicspline) in Uruguay, Southwest Argentina, South of Angola and in
      Sahel region in Africa.
      Due to the Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector failure, regular stripes of grassland probabilities
      are visible at parcel-level. This issue is more prominent in 2012, where GLAD Landsat ARD-2
      relies only in Landsat 7 imagery.
    Spectral overlap between natural and cultivated grasslands (especially fallow fields or
    lightly grazed areas) can result in misclassification.
    Regional differences in management practices may not be detectable in global models.
    Data likely reflects a snapshot per year, not intra-annual dynamics or land use rotations
    (e.g. grazing/fallow cycles).
    Definitions of "natural", "semi-natural", and "cultivated" vary by region and culture;
    users should not assume the dataset reflects legal or ecological classifications in every context.
    Short-term disturbances (fire, grazing, flood) might be:
      1. Misclassified as change
      2. Undetected if recovery is rapid
      3. Dataset may not represent functional health of grasslands (e.g. degradation, productivity loss).
    It's important to understand that while natural / semi-natural grassland areas can and do
    support grazing by wild ruminants and domestic livestock, these areas can still retain
    significant ecological value. These ecosystems continue to provide carbon storage, biodiversity
    habitat, and ecosystem services such as water regulation, pollination, and soil stabilization.
    However, once lost to cropland or pasture (through intensive management actions such as plowing
    or planting), or built areas (e.g. cities or energy infrastructure), or are seriously degraded
    (e.g. become bare ground) many of those benefits are lost or severely diminished.
    Very long crop rotations or shifting cultivation systems may be captured in our analysis as
    loss events. While these land use changes may be temporary or part of cyclical agricultural
    practices, they can resemble permanent conversion in satellite-based land cover datasets,
    particularly when vegetation structure changes significantly or persists across multiple years.
    Many forms of degradation, such as declines in plant diversity, aboveground productivity,
    soil health, or subtle structural changes, may not result in a detectable land cover change
    and are therefore not reflected as Natural / semi-natural grassland loss.
    Not all gross gains detected in natural / semi-natural grassland areas reflect deliberate or
    ecologically desirable restoration. Some observed transitions may result from land abandonment
    rather than active restoration, and in some cases regrowth may be dominated by invasive species
    or woody plant encroachment. Further, long fallow periods within rotational or shifting
    agricultural systems may be misclassified as gains when in fact they are part of a temporary
    cycle.  Some gains may reflect early successful stages or temporary states rather than mature,
    functioning, and recovered ecosystems.
    Area estimates for this analysis were derived using pixel counting, which involves summing
    the number of 30-m pixels classified as natural/semi-natural grasslands and converting this
    count to an area estimate. However, pixel counting is not best practice for area estimation.,
    as it does not account for classification uncertainties or biases.
  function_usage_notes: >
    This global grasslands dataset is intended to be used for monitoring natural/semi-natural
    grasslands in individual years as well as change over time. This dataset should be used
    when a user asks about area in a specific year or gain or loss of area between years for
    natural/semi-natural grasslands. This dataset may NOT be overlaid with DIST alert data
    to find alerts in natural/semi-natural grasslands. It can be used to find where
    natural/semi-natural grasslands were in 2020 and then see how they have changed since then.

    Any questions about snapshot or baseline natural/semi-natural in a given year, any
    questions about change over time in natural/semi-natural grasslands in a single time
    step or trends over the full time period. Any questions about spatial patterns of change
    in a given geography, any questions about hotspots and outlier detection. Any questions
    about the accuracy of the data (validation) or the cross-dataset consistence with ESA
    World Cover, UMD LC etc.

    This data should not be used for questions about cultivated grasslands, croplands, or
    open shrublands. We suggest guiding the LLM to use Global Pasture Watch data for any
    prompts specific to natural and semi-natural grasslands and to use the harmonized UMD
    LC data for any questions regarding cultivated, improved, or planted pasture, short
    vegetation, and croplands.

    The SBTN Natural Lands Map v1.1 is a 2020 baseline map of natural and non-natural land
    covers intended for use by companies setting science-based targets for nature, specifically
    the SBTN Land target #1: no conversion of natural ecosystems. This map is global with 30m
    resolution and was made by compiling existing global and regional data including the GLAD
    Global Land Cover and Change data, ESA WorldCover, and many other land cover and use datasets.

    "Natural" and "non-natural" definitions were adapted from the Accountability Framework
    initiative's definition of a natural ecosystem as "one that substantially resembles - in
    terms of species composition, structure, and ecological function - what would be found in
    a given area in the absence of major human impacts" and can include managed ecosystems as
    well as degraded ecosystems that are expected to regenerate either naturally or through
    management (AFi 2024). The SBTN Natural Lands Map operationalizes this definition by using
    proxies based on available data that align with AFi guidance to the extent possible.

    Classes includes natural: natural forests, natural short vegetation, natural water, mangroves,
    bare, snow, wet natural forests, natural peat forests, wet natural short vegetation,
    natural peat short vegetation; and Non-natural: crop, built, non-natural tree cover,
    non-natural short vegetation, non-natural water, wet non-natural tree cover,
    non-natural peat tree cover, wet non-natural short vegetation,
    non-natural peat short vegetation, non-natural bare.
  methodology: >
    The SBTN Natural Lands Map is a compilation of many global and regional land cover and
    land use datasets through a decision tree to disaggregate natural land from non-natural
    lands, according to definition of natural by the Accountability Framework. Global land
    cover and use datasets were overlaid with a hierarchy by land cover class, and then
    regional data replaced the global data, where available. The binary natural/non-natural
    classes were validated independently by IIASA.

    when using this map out of the conversion-free supply chains context.

    This map overestimates the extent of natural lands, and while remote sensing data, on
    which the map is based, can provide powerful insights, additional field work should be
    used for validation and to understand local dynamics. Caution should be used if calculating
    areas with the SBTN Natural Lands Map.

    Natural forests include the following classes: natural forest, natural peat forests,
    wetland natural forests, and mangroves (2,5,8,9).
  function_usage_notes: >
    The Natural Lands Map was created for companies to use as a baseline when identifying if
    there has been conversion of natural ecosystems in their supply chains since 2020. Users
    should identify change with land cover change data and then refer to the Natural Lands Map
    to see if the change occurred on land that was natural in 2020.

    Tree Cover Loss (Hansen/UMD/GLAD) maps annual global forest loss from 2001 to 2024 at
    30-meter resolution using Landsat satellite imagery. It detects stand-replacement
    disturbances in vegetation over 5 meters tall, including natural forests and plantations.
    The dataset supports monitoring annual tree cover loss and deforestation trends, fire
    impacts, and forestry practices, and is widely used for conservation, land-use planning,
    and environmental policy analysis. This dataset also includes annual greenhouse gas
    emissions due to tree cover loss, measure in MgCO2e (tonnes of CO2 equivalent).
  methodology: >
    This data set, a collaboration between the GLAD (Global Land Analysis & Discovery) lab
    at the University of Maryland (UMD), Google, USGS, and NASA, measures areas of tree cover
    loss across all global land (except Antarctica and other Arctic islands) at approximately
    30 x 30 meter resolution. The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery
    from the Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM), the Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+), and
    the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. Over 1 million satellite images were
    processed and analyzed, including over 600,000 Landsat 7 images for the 2000-2012 interval,
    and more than 400,000 Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images for updates for the 2011-2022 interval,
    and additional images used for 2023 and 2024. The clear land surface observations in the
    satellite images were assembled and a supervised learning algorithm was applied to identify
    per pixel tree cover loss.

    In this data set, "tree cover" is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height,
    and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities.
    Tree cover loss is defined as "stand replacement disturbance" which is considered to be
    clearing of at least half of tree cover within a 30-meter pixel. The exact threshold is
    variable both through space and time, and is biome-dependent. Tree cover loss may be the
    result of human activities, including forestry practices such as timber harvesting or
    deforestation (the conversion of natural forest to other land uses), as well as natural
    causes such as disease or storm damage. Fire is another widespread cause of tree cover loss,
    and can be either natural or human-induced.

    This data set has been updated five times since its creation, and now includes loss up to
    2024 (Version 1.12). The analysis method has been modified in numerous ways, including new
    data for the target year, re-processed data for previous years, and improved modelling and
    calibration. These modifications improve change detection for 2011-2024, including better
    detection of boreal loss due to fire, smallholder rotation agriculture in tropical forests,
    selective losing, and short cycle plantations. Since the entire historical timeseries was
    not reprocessed with the updated methodology, time-series assessments should be performed
    with caution.

    When zoomed out (< zoom level 13), pixels of loss are shaded according to the density of
    loss at the 30 x 30 meter scale. Pixels with darker shading represent areas with a higher
    concentration of tree cover loss, whereas pixels with lighter shading indicate a lower
    concentration of tree cover loss. There is no variation in pixel shading when the data is
    at full resolution (≥ zoom level 13). The tree cover canopy density of the displayed data
    varies according to the selection - use the legend on the map to change the minimum tree
    cover canopy density threshold.
  cautions: >
    In this data set, "tree cover" is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height,
    and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities.
    "Loss" indicates the removal or mortality of tree cover and can be due to a variety of
    factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. As such, "loss"
    does not equate to deforestation.

    Due to variation in research methodology and date of content, tree cover, loss, and gain
    data sets on GFW cannot be compared accurately against each other. Accordingly, "net" loss
    cannot be calculated by subtracting figures for tree cover gain from tree cover loss, and
    current (post-2000) tree cover cannot be determined by subtracting figures for annual tree
    cover loss from year 2000 tree cover.

    The 2011-2024 data was produced using an updated methodology. Comparisons between the
    original 2001-2010 data and the 2011-2024 update should be performed with caution.

    In the original publication, the authors evaluated the overall prevalence of false positives
    (commission errors) in this data at 13%, and the prevalence of false negatives (omission
    errors) at 12%, though the accuracy varies by biome and thus may be higher or lower in any
    particular location. The model often misses disturbances in smallholder landscapes, resulting
    in lower accuracy of the data in sub-Saharan Africa, where this type of disturbance is more
    common. Largely because of a delay between an actual disturbance and the event being observed
    by the satellite imagery, the authors are 75% confident that the loss occurred within the
    stated year, and 97% confident that it occurred within a year before or after. Users of the
    data can smooth out such uncertainty by examining the average over multiple years.

    Shows cumulative tree cover gain over the periods  2000-2020, 2005-2020, 2010-2020 or 2015-2020.
    Tree cover gain is defined as a change in tree height from under 5m to over 5m and is not
    necessarily the same as forest restoration. Avoid using the term “restoration” (other than to Use
    it to warn users about the differences between tree cover gain and restoration).
    Note that "net" loss cannot be calculated by subtracting gain from loss, as the methodologies for
    the two datasets differ.
    The data can be displayed as a bar chart showing the gain area per period.
    If asked for gain area through time, it should be be shown using bar charts with one bar per time period.
    Gain area for a given time period can be calculated by using the following:
    Area [Year1 to Year2] = Area [Year1 to 2020] - Area [Year2 to 2020].
    Warn that these are estimates that can be used as indicators of tree gain but are not suitable for
    precise verification of restoration activities at local scales.
  description: >
    Tree Cover Gain (Hansen/UMD/GLAD) identifies areas where new tree canopy was established
    between 2000 and 2012 at 30-meter resolution, using Landsat 7 imagery. It captures both
    natural forest regrowth and tree plantation cycles, and is useful for tracking large-scale
    forest recovery trends. Users should note that it is a cumulative layer and should not
    be combined directly with loss or tree cover data to calculate net change.
    This data set from the GLAD (Global Land Analysis & Discovery) lab at the University of Maryland
    measures areas of tree cover gain from the year 2000 to 2020 across the globe at 30 x 30 meter resolution,
    displayed as a 20-year cumulative layer. Tree cover gain was determined using tree height
    information from the years 2000 and 2020.
  methodology: >
    Tree height was modeled by the integration of the
    Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar forest structure measurements and Landsat
    analysis-ready data time-series. The NASA GEDI is a spaceborne lidar instrument operating onboard
    the International Space Station since April 2019. It provides point-based measurements
    of vegetation structure, including forest canopy height at latitudes between 52°N and 52°S globally.
    Gain was identified where pixels had tree height ≥5 m in 2020 and tree height <5 m in 2000.
    Tree cover gain may indicate a number of potential activities, including natural forest growth,
    the tree crop rotation cycle, or tree plantation management.
    When zoomed out (< zoom level 12), pixels of gain are shaded according to the density of gain
    at the 30 x 30 meter scale. Pixels with darker shading represent areas with a higher concentration
    of tree cover gain, whereas pixels with lighter shading indicate a lower concentration of tree cover gain.
    There is no variation in pixel shading when the data is at full resolution (≥ zoom level 12).
  cautions: >
    In this data set, “tree cover” is defined as woody vegetation with the height of 5 m and taller,
    and may take the form of natural woodlands, forests, or tree plantations across a range of canopy densities.
    Tree cover gain does not equate directly to restoration, afforestation or reforestation.
    Integrated use of other products such as canopy cover density data also available on GFW should be performed with caution.
    The authors evaluated the accuracy of the product, and the overall accuracy was found to be 99.3%,
    commission error (false positives) of 28.6%, and omission error (false negatives) of 42.2%.
    The accuracy does vary by biome and thus may be higher or lower in any particular location.
    As the omission error is higher than the commission error, this indicates that the product provides conservative
    estimates of forest dynamics. There was confusion between forest enhancement (existing forest height increase)
    and forest gain (establishment of forests within the year 2000 non-forest land), and this was more prominent
    in boreal forest areas where forest height in the year 2000 was difficult to determine.

  description: >
    Maps the balance between emissions from forest disturbances and carbon removals from forest growth
    between 2001 and 2024, using a globally consistent model. Negative values indicate forest areas
    acting as net carbon sinks, while positive values show net greenhouse gas sources.
    This dataset supports climate reporting, forest-based mitigation strategies, and greenhouse gas
    inventories by identifying where forests are contributing to or helping mitigate climate change.
    There is no timeseries; values are annual averages.
  methodology: >
    This net flux layer is part of the forest greenhouse gas flux model described in Harris et al. (2021).
    This paper introduces a geospatial monitoring framework for estimating global forest fluxes which can
    assist a variety of actors and organizations with tracking greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from forests
    and in decreasing emissions or increasing removals by forests. Net forest flux represents the exchange
    of GHGs between forests and the atmosphere, calculated as the difference between GHGs emitted by
    forests and carbon removed by (or sequestered by) forests during the model period. Net carbon flux
    is calculated by subtracting average gross removals from annual gross emissions in each forested pixel;
    negative values are where forests were net sinks of carbon and positive values are where forests were
    net sources of GHGs between 2001 and 2024. Net fluxes are calculated following IPCC Guidelines for
    national greenhouse gas inventories in each pixel where forests existed in 2000 or were established
    between 2000 and 2020 according to Potapov et al. 2022. This layer reflects the cumulative net flux
    during the model period (2001-2024) and must be divided by 24 to obtain average annual net flux;
    net flux values cannot be assigned to individual years of the model. All input layers were resampled
    to a common resolution of 0.00025 x 0.00025 degrees each to match Hansen et al. (2013).
    We have made several updates to the model since its original release. For documentation through the
    current version, please refer to this blog. For a more detailed description of the changes included
    through the 2023 tree cover loss launch (released spring 2024) and a comparison of the model's fluxes
    with those from the Global Carbon Budget and national greenhouse gas inventories,
    please refer to Gibbs et al. (2025).
    Net flux is available for download in two different area units over the model duration:
    1) megagrams of CO2e emissions/ha, and 2) megagrams of CO2e emissions/pixel. The first is appropriate
    for visualizing (mapping) net flux because it represents the density of GHG fluxes per hectare.
    The second is appropriate for calculating the net flux in an area of interest (AOI) because the values
    of the pixels in the AOI can be summed to obtain the total net flux for that area. The values in the
    latter were calculated by adjusting the net flux per hectare by the size of each pixel,
    which varies by latitude. When estimating net flux occurring over a defined number of years
    between 2001 and 2024, divide the values by the model duration and then multiply by the number of years
    n the period of interest. Both datasets only include pixels within forests, as defined in the methods of
    Harris et al. (2021) and updated with tree cover gain through 2020.
  cautions: >
    Data are the product of modeling and thus have an inherent degree of error and uncertainty.
    Users are strongly encouraged to read and fully comprehend the metadata and other availabledocumentation
    prior to data use. Net flux reflects the total over the model period of 2001-2024, not an annual
    time series from which a trend can be derived. Thus, values must be divided by 24 to calculate
    average annual net flux. Uncertainty is higher in gross removals than emissions, particularly driven
    by uncertainty in removal factors. These uncertainties are propagated to the uncertainty in net flux.
    Values are applicable to forest areas only (canopy cover >30 percent and >5 m height or areas with
    tree cover gain). See Harris et al. (2021) for further information on the forest definition used in
    the analysis. Emissions reflect stand-replacing disturbances as observed in Landsat satellite imagery
    and do not include emissions from unobserved forest degradation.
    Activity data used as the basis of the estimates contain temporal inconsistencies:
    Removals data contain temporal inconsistencies because tree cover gain represents a cumulative total
    from 2000-2020, rather than annual gains as estimated through 2024.
    Improvements in the detection of tree cover loss due to the incorporation of new satellite data and
    methodology changes between 2011 and 2015 may result in higher estimates of emissions in recent years
    compared to earlier years. Refer here for additional information.
    Large jumps in net flux along some boundary are due to the use of ecozone-specific removal factors.
    The changes in net flux occur at ecozone boundaries, where different removal factors are applied on each side.
    This dataset has been updated since its original publication. See Overview for more information.

    Shows tree cover % per pixel for years 2000, for woody vegetation greater than 5 meters in height.
    If combined with primary forest or IFL layers, we can use the term ‘forest’ to describe results. Otherwise,
    only use the term 'tree cover'.
    Binned % tree cover extent can be reported in bar chart or pie chart.
    Default bins are >0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-100%, but user can specify bins (i.e. greater and smaller than 30%).
    When calculating area in bins, exclude tree cover area = 0 (and specify that the exclusion has happened).
    Use the tree cover loss and gain
    data for data on change in tree area. Cannot be used to asses pixel-level percent changes (gains and losses).

    Tree Cover (Hansen/UMD/GLAD) provides global percent tree canopy cover at 30-meter resolution for the
    years 2000, based on Landsat 7 imagery. It represents the density of vegetation over 5 meters
    tall, including both natural forests and plantations. This dataset is useful for establishing
    historical baselines and comparing tree cover density across different landscapes.

  methodology: >
    This data set, a collaboration between the GLAD (Global Land Analysis & Discovery) lab at the
    University of Maryland, Google, USGS, and NASA, displays tree cover over all global land
    (except for Antarctica and a number of Arctic islands) for the years 2000 at 30 x 30 meter resolution.
    “Percent tree cover” is defined as the density of tree canopy coverage of the land surface and is color-coded
    by density bracket (see legend).
  cautions: >
    For the purpose of this study, “tree cover” was defined as all vegetation taller than 5 meters in height.
    “Tree cover” is the biophysical presence of trees and may take the form of natural forests or plantations
    existing over a range of canopy densities.

  description: >
    Shows the dominant driver of tree cover loss over the time period 2001-2024.
    A driver is defined as the direct cause of tree cover loss, and can include both temporary
    disturbances (natural or anthropogenic) or permanent loss of tree cover due to a change to
    a non-forest land use (e.g., deforestation).  The dominant driver is defined as the direct
    driver that caused the majority of tree cover loss within each 1 km cell over the time period.
    Classes are defined as follows:
    - Permanent agriculture: Long-term, permanent tree cover loss for small- tolarge-scale agriculture.
    - Hard commodities: Loss due to the establishment or expansion of mining or energy infrastructure.
    - Shifting cultivation: Tree cover loss due to small- to medium-scale clearing for temporary
      cultivation that is later abandoned and followed by subsequent regrowth of secondary forest or
      vegetation.
    - Logging: Forest management and logging activities occurring within managed, natural or
      semi-natural forests and plantations, often with evidence of forest regrowth or planting in
      subsequent years.
    - Wildfire: Tree cover loss due to fire with no visible human conversion or agricultural
      activity afterward. Fires may be started by natural causes (e.g. lightning) or may be
      related to human activities (accidental or deliberate).
    - Settlements and infrastructure: Tree cover loss due to expansion and intensification of roads,
      settlements, urban areas, or built infrastructure (not associated with other classes).
      Other natural disturbances: Tree cover loss due to other non-fire natural disturbances
      (e.g., landslides, insect outbreaks, river meandering). If loss due to natural causes is
      followed by salvage or sanitation logging, it is classified as logging.
  methodology: >
    These data were produced in a collaboration between the World Resources Institute and
    Google DeepMind. The data were developed using a global neural network model (ResNet)
    trained on a set of samples collected through visual interpretation of very high-resolution
    satellite imagery. The model used satellite imagery (Landsat 7 & 8, Sentinel-2) and ancillary
    data to classify the seven driver categories. Overall accuracy of the model is 90.5%, with
    regional accuracies varying from 82.8% in Southeast Asia to 94.1% in Asia. Global per class
    producer's and user's accuracy are highest for the permanent agriculture, logging, and
    wildfire classes (over 90%), and generally lower for rarer classes, such as hard commodities,
    settlements and infrastructure, and other natural disturbances. A full description of the
    methods and accuracy statistics are available in the publication.
    The data is also available on [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/projects_landandcarbon_assets_wri_gdm_drivers_forest_loss_1km_v1_2_2001_2024)
  cautions: >
    The grouping of drivers into deforestation and temporary disturbances (i.e., likely
    followed by regrowth) is indicative of how these classes are defined in the data and
    should be considered an approximation. This product does not monitor regrowth or
    permanence of loss following each loss event.
    This product does not distinguish between the loss of natural forest and planted trees
    (e.g., plantations, tree crops, or agroforestry systems). While tree cover loss associated
    with the permanent agriculture, hard commodities, and settlements & infrastructure classes
    represent a close approximation of deforestation, they do not always represent the conversion
    of natural forests to other land uses and in some cases may represent loss of planted trees.
    Similarly, replacement of natural forest with wood fiber plantations is not distinguished
    from routine harvesting within existing plantations established before 2000, as these
    are both included in the logging class.
    These data are limited in scope to attributing drivers to tree cover loss as mapped by the
    Hansen et al. 2013 tree cover loss product, and therefore the detection of loss is subject
    to the accuracy of that product. This product shows the dominant driver in each 1 km cell
    over the entire period. It does not show multiple drivers if they occur in the same cell at
    smaller scales, nor does it detail the sequence of drivers if multiple occurred at different
    times within the period. A full description of limitations is included in the publication.

      "\"MAIN THREATS: Agricultural intensification and expansion industrialisation; Urbanisation; Forest fires; Man-Animal Conflict. Chandaka holds a population of 65-70 elephants. The Sanctuary is like an island for these pachyderms, which sometimes go out into the surrounding villages and raid crops. This causes much conflict with the villagers. Elephant proof trenches, masonary walls and electric fencing is being presently carried out. Morever, elephants regularly stray out of the Sanctuary and enter the outskirts of Bhubaneswar city, damaging farms and houses. This has also resulted in an increase in human casualties in the last 5 years. Rapid growth of the city borders and urbanisation results in conflict with the elephants. The five villages located inside the Sanctuary have converted the valleys and plains into paddy fields, resluting in acute shortage of fodder for the resident elephants. At least 5,000 cows, mostly feral, graze inside the Sanctuary further add to the competition for the grass (Biswajit Mohanty pers. comm. 2004). There are 5 villages inside the Sanctuary and 22 on the fringes. Around 562 families have already been shifted out, but there is still pressure for fuel wood on the Sanctuary. Forest fires used to be a major cause of concern, but few were witnessed in 2001. Awareness among the local people for wildlife is needed and Wild Orissa, an NGO, is attempting the construction of an Environmental Interpretation Centre at Godibari.\",\"AVIFAUNA: Kumarkhunti reservoir used to hold breeding populations of about 5,000 Asian Openbill Anastomus oscitans on the bamboo along the shores, but for the past four years the storks are not nesting as the trees have died due to excessive deposition of uric acid from the guano. But with the planting of new trees, the storks are likely to return for breeding. Wetlands International (2002) estimates 125,000 as the breeding population of the Asian Openbill in South Asia, which means that before the birds abandoned the nesting colony, about 4% of the biogeographical population used to breed at this site. Besides the two widely distributed Gyps vultures, the globally threatened Purple Wood-Pigeon Columba punicea and Broadtailed Grass-Warbler Schoenicola platyura have also been reported by the participants of the BNHS-IBA workshops. The site lies in Biome-11 (Indo-Malayan Tropical Dry Zone). Of the 59 species listed in Biome-11 from India, 25 have been found at this IBA site, proving it a good representative of Biome-11 species. Three species occurring in Biome-10 (Indian Peninsula Tropical Moist Forest) are also reported from here, but need further confirmation. They are the Small Green-billed Malkoha Phaenicophaeus viridirostris, Indian Scimitar Babbler Pomatorhinus horsfieldii and Loten’s Sunbird Nectarinia lotenia. OTHER KEY FAUNA: Not much is known about other wildlife of this area, except that it holds a population of about 70 Asian Elephant. Other mammals recorded include Wild Dog Coun alphinus, Leopard Panthera pardus, Spotted Deer Axis axis, Barking Deer Muntiacus muntjak, Sloth Bear Melursus ursinus. Pythons and Monitor Lizards also occur here in good numbers.\",nature conservation and research | tourism/recreation,58.44391196,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,8.670659656,0.0,Chandaka - Dampara Wildlife Sanctuary,18334\n",
      "\"MAIN THREATS: Fishing; Poaching; Fragmentation of habitat by canals; Livestock grazing; Tourism; Forest fire. There are 53 villages inside the Sanctuary and there is immense pressure due to fishing on the Mahanadi river, although it was banned on a 27-km stretch of the river to protect the Gharial. These villages inside the Sanctuary are a grave threat, since they carry out a number of unsustainable activities including goat and cattle grazing in large numbers. Most of the fertile valleys are converted into paddy fields. There is use of poison in the Mahanadi gorge inside the sanctuary (since the last two years) to catch fish which will severely impact the ecology. The Sanctuary is a haven for timber smugglers and poachers from the surrounding small towns like Narsinghpur and Angul who enter the area almost every day for timber felling and poaching. Snares and traps are regularly laid throughout the sanctuary. Hundreds of local poachers enter the forest everyday with countrymade guns. There is severe loss of habitat and the rate has accelerated in the last 5 years by heavily armed timber smugglers who have killed forest guards on many occasions. Fire is also a major problem cause of forest loss especially during summer (Biswajit Mohanty pers. comm. 2004). According to Wild Orissa, a local NGO, the elephant corridor between Satkosia Gorge Wildlife Sanctuary and Kapilas forest in Dhenkal district has been severed at many places due to canals laid under the Rengali Irrigation Project. Before constructing the canals, the government had promised that corridors would remain intact, but this premise was not kept, and nearly 100 Asian Elephants are isolated in Kapilas forest, unable to access the rich forests and water resources of Satkosia Gorge (Monalisa Bhujabal in litt. 2002).\",\"AVIFAUNA: Besides the two critically endangered Gyps vultures, which are widespread in any case, this site harbours two globally threatened species: Indian Skimmer Rynchops albicollis and Bristled Grass- Warbler or Grassbird Chaetornis striatus. The Indian Skimmer breeds on the islands in the Mahanadi river (B. C. Choudhury pers. comm. 2003). This site is designated as an IBA based on the presence of these two globally threatened species and also as the breeding site of the Indian Skimmer. The bird life is fairly typical of eastern India. Of the 59 species listed in Biome-11 by BirdLife International (undated), 32 are found at this site. Four species of Biome-10 (Indian Peninsula Tropical Moist Forest) are also reported i.e. Malabar Trogon Harpactes fasciatus, Malabar Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros coronatus, Indian Scimitar Babbler Pomatorhinus horsfieldii and Small Green-billed or Blue-faced Malkoha Phaenicophaeus viridirostris. These are at the northeastern extreme of their range. Ripley (1978) in his paper on the bird fauna of the Simlipal forest area in Mayurbhanj and Dhenkanal districts mentions Tytler’s Warbler Phylloscopus tytleri “in forest near the Mahanadi River in Dhenkanal District”. This interesting record extends the winter range considerably east from the River Tapti in Madhya Pradesh. It seems to have been missed by Ali and Ripley (1987) and Grimmett et al. (1998). OTHER KEY FAUNA: Most of the representative large vertebrates of tropical dry deciduous forests of the Indian plains are found in Satkosia WLS, such as Tiger Panthera tigris, Leopard Panthera pardus, Sloth Bear Melursus ursinus, Wild Dog Cuon alpinus, Gaur Bos frontalis, Chital Axis axis, Barking Deer Muntiacus muntjak, Bluebull Boselaphus tragocamelus, Four-horned Antelope Tetracerus quadricornis, and Wild Boar Sus scrofa, as well as the Asian Elephant Elephas maximus.\",nature conservation and research | tourism/recreation,18.3847109,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,36413.32053,93.68584662,Satkosia Gorge Wildlife Sanctuary,18337\n",
      "\"MAIN THREATS: Poaching; Overgrazing on the fringes and around villages. According to Srivastava and Singh (2002), the major issues affecting Simlipal and requiring management interventions with research data and support are: – Man-wildlife interface and mitigation of man-wildlife conflict. – Management of ecotourism. – Impacts of incompatible developmental programmes launched by other agencies. – Biodiversity status assessment and monitoring with particular emphasis on invertebrates and lower plants. – Impacts of habitat alteration. – Checking large-scale hunting, illegal extraction of timber and collection of non-timber forest products, human encroachment into forested areas, increasing cattle population, forest fire. The Wildlife Society of Orissa (WSO) has reported that overgrazing is the major problem, as goat rearing is very popular here. There are presently 65 villages inside Simlipal TR, all of which have a population of goats. An estimated 7000 goats from the villages inside the Park and another 70,000 from the peripheral villages of the Sanctuary graze inside the Park daily. This adversely affects wild herbivores like Sambar, Barking Deer, and Gaur. Organised poaching of Elephants, ritual mass hunting (Akhand Shikar) of animals by tribals during April, and poisoning is a major problem. Akhand Shikar (non-stop hunting) for seven days occurs in April every year. The Forest Department and NGOs have started a campaign and education programme among tribal against mass killing, because of which many villagers have now stopped participating in this organised ritual annual hunt. The tiger population (estimated at 99 as per 2004 census) is concentrated in the core area of 845 sq. kms. due to the extensive disturbance of habitat in the buffer area of 2,200 sq. kms. There is a big question mark on the future of Simplipal’s tigers. Black tigers indicative of genetic aberration have been sighted by forest officials in recent years. Some experts believe that this is the result of inbreeding of tigers since the population is confined to a small patch and no corridors for movement of tigers to other forests like Keonjhar and Kuldiha exist any more. Lack of management resources is another major problem in this large forest. The forest authorities have only four vehicles, shared by five rangers! As many as 40 posts are lying vacant (P. Das, in litt. 2000). For the last 20 years, the district authorities have not been able to shift four villages from the core area, though the Park authorities have deposited funds for this purpose.\",\"AVIFAUNA: Despite the great importance of Simlipal National Park to the Orissa Government and Project Tiger authorities, its bird life is not well documented. However, Jain (2001) says that more than 250 species of birds are found here. Simlipal forest stands as a link between the flora and fauna of southern India and the Himalayas. For instance, the Red-breasted Falconet Microhierax caerulescens was sighted in Simlipal in 1987 (Prakash and Rahmani 1989), far south of its known range in the Himalayan foothills, Sikkim, Bhutan and Assam (Ali and Ripley 1987). BirdLife International has identified 59 species in Biome-11, of which 33 have been reported till now from Simlipal. Besides, six species of Biome-10 are also seen. Species at the northernmost extreme of their range are the Malabar Trogon Harpactes fasciatus, Malabar Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros coronatus, and Malabar Whistling Thrush Myiophonus horsfieldii. The essentially Himalayan species such as Large Green-billed Malkoha Phaenicophaeus tristis and Blue-throated Barbet Megalaima asiatica are near their southern limit in Simlipal (Kazmierczak and Singh 1998). Ripley (1978) has recorded Picus canus, another Himalayan bird with disjunct distribution in Mayurbhanj district in Orissa (see map. 6, plate 16, Grimmett et al. 1999). Other Himalayan species found in these forests are the Rufous-capped Babbler Stachyris ruficeps and Striped Tit Babbler Macronous gularis (Ripley 1978). Thus, Simlipal is a very interesting IBA, not only from the view point of protection of tropical dry forest avifauna, but also from the biogeographic point of view as it connects the Eastern Himalayan avifauna to that of the Western Ghats, albeit through a weak link. OTHER KEY FAUNA: Important mammals of the Park include Tiger Panthera tigris, Leopard Panthera pardus, Asian Elephant Elephas maximus, Sambar Cervus unicolor, Mouse Deer Moschiola meminna, Chital Axis axis, Gaur Bos frontalis, Wild Dog Cuon alpinus, Sloth Bear Melursus ursinus and Striped Hyena Hyaena hyaena. Among reptiles, Mugger Crocodylus palustris is the most prominent species. King Cobra Ophiophagus hannah is also found.\",nature conservation and research | tourism/recreation,144.6673005,0.286241211,0.0,,0.0,,65696.30976,258.5543229,Simlipal National Park,18338\n",
      "\"MAIN THREATS: Human pressure; Livestock grazing; Encroachment of forestland; Forest fire; Unsustainable exploitation of the forest resources; Illegal felling. According to Kotwal (1997), the highly endangered Wild Buffalo used to occur here nearly 70 years ago. At present, they are found in Udanti Wildlife Sanctuary in Chhattisgarh, about 20 km away but there is a Patdhara Reserve Forest corridor. Efforts should be made to improve the habitat so that the Wild Buffalo can come back to Sunabeda using this corridor. This would give a boost to the protection of this Sanctuary, which is important for birds also. About 64 villages, with a human population of 20,000, fragment this Sanctuary and there is a large population of cattle. The villagers subsist on forest products to a great extent, as they have land holdings with poor yield. Grazing and encroachment of forest land for cultivation of Cannabis sativa are major threats to the Sanctuary. Graziers from other states including Rajasthan arrive here with their camels and goats, which compete with local herbivores for the grass. Though there is a proposal for a tiger reserve, there are extensive encroachments inside the sanctuary. It is doubtful if these people could be shifted (Biswajit Mohanty pers. comm. 2004). The core area of Sunabeda could be increased southwards across the Indra nullah (stream), to add 30,000 ha of forest without human habitation (Kotwal 1997).\",\"AVIFAUNA: Around 200 species of birds have been reported from this area (H. K. Bisht in litt. 2002). BirdLife International (undated) has listed 59 species in Biome-11 (Indo-Malayan Tropical Dry Zone), of which 18 have been seen till now, but more are likely to occur. Except for the two Gyps vultures, which are now included in the Critically Endangered category by BirdLife International (2001) due to their steep decline during the last 10 years, none of the other species is threatened with extinction. Biome-11 includes a wide range of habitats, including forests and open country. Many of the species listed have adapted to man-modified habitats. Some species have deviated so far from their earlier distribution that they may not be useful in identifying IBAs for the protection of this biome (BirdLife International, undated). OTHER KEY FAUNA: Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary has certainly seen better days. It had Swamp Deer Cervus duvauceli branderi and Wild Buffalo Bubalus bubalis (= arnee) (Kotwal 1997). Even now, typical central Indian wild mammals such as Tiger Panthera tigris, Leopard P. pardus, Gaur Bos frontalis, Sloth Bear Melursus ursinus, Barking Deer Muntiacus muntjak, Wild Boar Sus scrofa and Bluebull Boselaphus tragocamelus are found, although depleted by poaching. Among the non-human primates, Common Langur Semnopithecus entellus and Rhesus Monkey Macaca mulatta are very common.\",nature conservation and research | urban/industrial/transport,50.57979272,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,17418.58856,77.96773834,Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary,18339\n",

      "\"MAIN THREATS: Poaching and illegal trade of birds; Reed Harvesting. Charaching is causing irreparable damage to the avifauna of Mangaljodi. There are about 80 poachers in the village, proficient in various techniques of killing birds. These birds are regularly sold in the open market, at rates varying from Rs 20/- to Rs. 60/- per bird, depending on the species and method of killing. A proficient poacher can earn anything between Rs 10,000/- to Rs 80,000/- in a year. The local police and forest authorities are helpless spectators, as political involvement remains high. Moreover, the collection of birds’ eggs and their sale in the open market is another big problem. Strict vigil is required to conserve the Mangaljodi waterfowl breeding habitat, by local participation in the form of patrolling, educating the masses about bird conservation and their habitat. Wild Orissa, an NGO, is actively working on such issues, to prevent damaging activities in the area.\",\"AVIFAUNA: The marshes around Mangaljodi, and the open water between Kalupada Ghat and Teenmuhani, attract a large congregation of waterfowl, especially the dabbling ducks such as Northern Pintail Anas acuta, Northern Shoveller A. clypeata, Garganey A. querquedula and Brahminy Shelduck Tadorna ferruginea. A very huge population of waterfowl is found on this site. The estimates were over 3,00,000 and 2,40,000 respectively for 2002 and 2003 (S. Balachandran pers. comm. 2003). Populations of at least 15 species exceed 1% of their bio-geographical population, as estimated by Wetlands International (2002). Over 100,000 Tufted Pochard Aythya fuligula representing 10% of the geographical population have been recorded. Red-crested Pochard Netta rufina also occurs in tens of thousands, along with Large Whistling Duck Dendrocygna bicolor (14,500) and Lesser Whistling Duck D. javanicus (2800). The reed beds are frequented by over 10,000 Purple Moorhen or Swamphen Porphyrio porphyrio, 15,000 Asian Openbill Anastomus oscitans, 15,000 Common Moorhen Gallinula chloropus and more than 5,000 Cotton Teal or Pygmy Goose Nettapus coromandelicus. Over 400 Grey-headed Lapwings Vanellus cinereus were counted in Mangaljodi area which is more than 1% of their biogeographical population (Balachandran et al. 2002a, b, 2003). The reed beds are also roosting sites for many thousands of Streaked Weaver Ploceus manyar and Baya Weaver Ploceus philippinus, Indian Great Reed Warbler or Clamorous Reed Warbler Acrocephalus stentoreus, Asian Pied Starling Sturnus contra, and Red Munia or Red Avadavat Amandava amandava.

      "\"MAIN THREATS: Indiscriminate fishing; Pollution; Poaching of birds. Chilika Lake has undergone major ecological changes for the last several years, mostly due to the salinity changes caused by choking of the outer-channel and closure of the Lake’s mouth to the sea, and the restoration measures (providing of a new mouth) undertaken by the Chilika Development Authority. Nalabana Island has large breeding colonies of Gull-billed and River Terns. But during the onset of monsoon in May, many nests are washed away by floods caused by heavy rain and wind. Near total breeding failure was noticed in the above two species in 2002 and over 75% in 2003 (Balachandran et al. 2002a, 2002b, 2003). Nests of the River Tern are generally prone to flooding in most of their breeding areas (Ali and Ripley 1987), but the poor breeding success from this largest colony will have a particularly adverse effect on this species. Conservation measures are urgently needed for these species to protect them from natural calamities. The BNHS suggested flat floating platforms 1 m high with an area of 25 x 10 m, covered with 15 cm or more of sand or pebbles, as nest beds in the major nesting localities as a possible conservation measure for breeding terns. Birds are also being adversely affected by the increasing numbers of mechanized boats which emit smoke, noise and oil pollution. The forest department constructed raised platforms of sand to serve as nesting sites for the breeding terns inside the Nalabana Sanctuary. But during the breeding season of 2004, none of the terns laid nests in these platforms. Nalabana being a popular tourist destination witnesses a large number of visitors who litter the place which is a grave threat. This litter is periodically burnt off which releases noxious gases that obviously shall affect the birds since most of the waste is plastic wrappers and bags (Biswajit Mohanty pers. comm. 2004).\",\"AVIFAUNA: Chilika Lake in general and Nalabana area in particular are among the most important waterfowl habitats in India. The total number of waterfowl in Chilika is close to 8,00,000 birds. Of the 211 species of birds recorded in Chilika and its environs, 121 species were reported from Nalabana. Seven Vulnerable species, and many Near Threatened species are found. In January 2003, more than 4,50,000 birds were counted on Nalabana Island, and more than 2,40,000 birds were counted in the northern sector from Kalupadaghat to Teenmuhani area. Very large numbers of birds were also observed in the Kansari River and Gangadharpur area (Sana Nairi village). Similarly, the unapproachable areas in the southern sector near Taltaola, Rambha, Naupada and outer-channel Jahnikuda provide refuge to more than 1,70,000 ducks and waders. It is estimated that Chilika Lake supported over 8,00,000 birds during the 2002- 2003 winter season (Balachandran et al. 2003). Large numbers of birds such as the Pintail Anas acuta (80,000), Garganey Anas querquedula, Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa (48,000), Gadwall Anas strepera (1,00,000) Eurasian Wigeon Anas penelope (40,000) Brown-headed Gull Larus brunnicephalus (20,000), and the marine terns (Large Crested Sterna bergii and Lesser Crested Sterna bengalensis) congregate on and around the island at dusk for roosting, and most of them depart in the morning. Over 1,000 Bar-headed Geese Anser indicus spend the winter at Nalabana every year. During 3 years of monitoring the maximum wader population (1,44,000) was recorded in January 2003. The rare Asian Dowitcher Limnodromus semipalmatus was seen in small numbers (10-15) and a total of five individuals were also ringed between 2002 and 2003. Large congregations (>1000) of Lesser Whistling Duck Dendrocygna javanicus were seen during January 2003. Over 5,000 Brahminy Shelducks Tadorna ferruginea were observed between Satapada (outer-channel area) and Nalabana. The globally threatened Pallas’s Fish-Eagle Haliaeetus leucoryphus was regularly sighted, solitarily or in pairs in Nalabana from December to March. Among other threatened species of Chilika Lake, between 175 to 300 Spot-billed Pelican were seen. Large breeding colonies of terns, namely the River Tern, Gullbilled Tern and Little Tern Sterna albifrons, along with the waders such as Black-winged Stilt Himantopus himantopus were recorded at Nalabana Island. The majority of nests were found in the middle of the island. Among the 1,032 nests noted in 2002, 540 and 323 respectively belonged to River Tern and Gull-billed Tern. The other two wader species breeding at Nalabana are Oriental Pratincole Glareola maldivarum and Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus (Balachandran et al. 2002a). Many waders and ducks occur in much greater numbers than their 1% population threshold determined by Wetlands International (2002). For some species such as the Spoon-billed Sandpiper and Asian Dowitchers, this site is extremely important in India. OTHER KEY FAUNA: Chilika Lake hosts 158 types of fish and prawn species. Fish include both marine and estuarine species. Penaeus indicus and Penaeus monodon are commercially important prawns. The sand crab Scylla serrata is the most abundant commercial crab of Chilika. A remnant population of the highly endangered Irrawady Dolphin Orcaella brevirostris occurs only in Chilika in India.\",fisheries/aquaculture | nature conservation and research | tourism/recreation,0.8704721406,0.0,0.0,,71.48831134,,205.0288963,431.6067026,Nalabana Bird Sanctuary (Chilika Lake),18335\n",
      "\"MAIN THREATS: Brackish water prawn culture ponds; Agriculture; Disturbance to birds; Bangladeshi Immigrants. With the recent changes in land use pattern all along the Orissa coast (evident after 1993), the coastal wetlands and the agricultural fields adjoining wetlands are increasingly being converted into brackish water prawn culture ponds. The wetland adjoining the mangrove forest of Bhitarkanika harbours a good population of migratory waterfowl, and the conversion of coastal wetlands around Bhitarkanika has resulted in a loss of wintering ground for these birds. Due to the conversion of agricultural fields to prawn culture ponds, the Asian Openbills are losing feeding ground. In the near future, this may affect the breeding behaviour of these birds and may be detrimental for their survival in the long run (Pandav 1996). It has been alleged by NGOs working in Orissa that the large number of Bangladeshi immigrants living and operating around Bhitarkanika WLS are adversely affecting the Park and could threaten the survival of the Estuarine Crocodiles. While the government estimates their number at about 2,000, the Wildlife Society of Orissa has said that there are at least 15,000 in and around Bhitarkanika. Two hundred mechanised boats reportedly fish illegally in the creeks here, which is the main home for the crocodiles as well. Large-scale mangrove depletion too is attributed to this large immigrant population.\",\"AVIFAUNA: Nearly 220 species of birds have been recorded from this area (Kar 1991, Pandav 1996). Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the few protected areas in India which has six sympatric species of kingfishers: Pied Ceryle rudis, Common Alcedo atthis, Brownwinged Halcyon amauropterus, White-throated Halcyon smyrnensis, Black-capped H. pileata and Collared Todiramphus chloris. Storkbilled Kingfisher Halcyon capensis was also recorded from this IBA (Mr. Anup Nayak pers. comm. to Bishwajit Mohanty). The Brown-winged and Collared kingfishers, along with the Mangrove Whistler Pachycephala grisola are mainly restricted to mangroves in India. In the Indian subcontinent, the Mangrove Whistler is otherwise found only in the Sunderbans of West Bengal and Bangladesh, and in a narrow zone fringing the shore in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Ali and Ripley 1987). According to Pandav (1996), fifty-seven species of winter visitors are recorded, with the highest numbers between November and February. The Northern Pintail Anas acuta is the most abundant migratory waterfowl. Occurrence of more than 3,000 Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa is also notable. The Wetlands International (2002) estimate of 1% biogeographical population of this bird is 1000 individuals, so Bhitarkanika holds about 3% of the total population of this species. Eighty-two species are reported breeding, including the Near Threatened Black-necked Stork Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus. Breeding colonies of Asian Openbill Anastomus oscitans, Intermediate Egret Mesophoyx intermedia, Little Egret Egretta garzetta, Grey Heron Ardea cinerea, Purple Heron Ardea purpurea, Black-crowned Night-heron Nycticorax nycticorax, Little Cormorant Phalacrocorax niger, Darter Anhinga melanogaster and Oriental White Ibis Threskiornis melanocephalus are located on Bhitarkanika Island in the Sanctuary. This breeding colony of water birds is listed as one amongst the top five heronries in India (Subramanya 1996). A survey of the heronry in July and August, 1993, revealed 9,910 nests on 5,500 trees, with the majority of nests, i.e. 7,800, belonging to the Asian Openbill (Pandav 1996). The next most abundant was the Intermediate Egret. Grey Heron had 200 nests, and Oriental Darter , 192 nests. This is the largest known breeding colony of this Near Threatened species, perhaps equal to the one in Keoladeo National Park at Bharatpur (another IBA). The Painted Stork Mycteria leucocephala also breeds here, but in small numbers. Pandav (1996) could locate only 28 nests on tall trees of Sonneratia apetala and Xylocarpus moluccensis, away from the main heronry. The Lesser Adjutant Leptoptilos javanicus was also observed nesting, its total population was estimated to be 20 (Pandav 1996). Anup Nayak (in litt. 2003) has mentioned sighting a flock of more than 50 Indian Skimmer Rynchops albicollis in Bhitarkanika in January 2003. Three species recorded during the survey, but not on the checklist of birds of Orissa prepared by the State Forest Department (Dani 1992), and hence considered new sight records for Orissa, are Eurasian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, Pintail Snipe Gallinago stenura and Chestnut-capped Babbler Timalia pileata. The Eurasian Oystercatcher is a common winter visitor to the west coast of India, but is uncommon on the east coast (Ali and Ripley 1987). A group of 19 Eurasian Oystercatchers was seen in the intertidal zones of the Gahirmatha coast during December and January. Pintail Snipe, a winter visitor to India, occurs in northeast India, but is more common in southern India and in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Ali and Ripley 1987). In Bhitarkanika, this snipe was seen along the marshy edges of the pools in winter. The southernmost limit of the Chestnut-capped Babbler in India was Calcutta (Ali and Ripley 1987). Small parties of 8-10 birds were observed in the Phoenix paludosa bushes of the mangrove forest (Pandav 1996). OTHER KEY FAUNA: Bhitarkanika WLS and NP harbour the highest density of Saltwater Crocodile Crocodylus porosus in India. It also has the distinction of having the world’s largest known breeding ground of the Olive Ridley Sea Turtle Lepidochelys olivacea at Gahirmatha, located on its eastern boundary (Das and Kar 1990). Leopard Panthera pardus, and Wild Boar Sus scrofa are the other larger animals in the sanctuary. Water monitor Varanus salvator and King Cobra Ophiophagus hannah are also found.\",nature conservation and research | tourism/recreation,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.216213608,1.441557514,Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park,18333\n",

For example, Chandaka faces both urban expansion and agricultural pressure while trying to maintain elephant corridors.\\\\n\\\\nData Limitations:\\\\n- Some sites lack complete data across all threat categories\\\\n- Historical comparison data is limited\\\\n- Protected area calculations are missing for some sites\\\\n\\\\nWould you like me to dive deeper into any particular threat category or site? 🌿\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={\\'id\\': \\'msg_01D6ykS45fsLi9v6g8L3ZSX4\\', \\'model\\': \\'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\\', \\'stop_reason\\': \\'end_turn\\', \\'stop_sequence\\': None, \\'usage\\': {\\'input_tokens\\': 9239, \\'output_tokens\\': 457, \\'cache_creation_input_tokens\\': 0, \\'cache_read_input_tokens\\': 0}} id=\\'run-7be3afec-3b1f-4f0c-8211-3bc5cfbce48a-0\\' usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 9239, \\'output_tokens\\': 457, \\'total_tokens\\': 9696, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'cache_read\\': 0, \\'cache_creation\\': 0}}', name='kba-insight-tool', tool_call_id='df0d9e70-4f41-4284-aa1f-322ce5204f99', artifact='hello')"

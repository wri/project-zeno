The reserve is managed by local communities, emphasizing community-based forestry practices. The tree cover here reaches nearly 100% of the area, reflecting robust forest conservation efforts.\n",
       "\n",
       "The **Lubudi-Sampwe Hunting Domain** covers 1,308,012 hectares and is characterized by miombo woodlands and humid grass savannas. The site is home to diverse fauna including the African buffalo and hippopotamus, with a tree cover of 574,201 hectares, equating to 44%.\n",
       "\n",
       "The **Bomu Wildlife and Hunting Reserve** and **Swa-Kibula Hunting Domain** are both under the full management of the **Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature**. They are characterized by mixed savannas and forest galleries, with 100% of their areas under conservation. The Bomu Reserve, covering 355,272 hectares, is known for species like the vulnerable African softshell turtle (*Trionyx triunguis*), while the Swa-Kibula domain, spanning 63,573 hectares, hosts a range of species, including the critically endangered African forest elephant (*Loxodonta cyclotis*).\n",

       "Conservation and restoration projects are another common theme. Efforts to restore native forests, such as the reforestation projects in **Tunari** aimed at recovering kewiña forests, highlight the focus on habitat restoration and biodiversity conservation across these KBAs. These projects often involve collaborations between governmental and non-governmental organizations, as seen with entities like the EcoAndina Foundation and the Alexander von Humboldt Institute in the **Eastern Risaralda Forests** KBA in Colombia.\n",
       "\n",
       "In some areas, there is a notable emphasis on scientific research and monitoring as part of the management strategy. For instance, the **Tunari National Park** is a site of active scientific research, and the **Reserva Paisajística Nor Yauyos Cochas** has a conservation promotion and monitoring committee composed of various governmental and civil institutions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lastly, the presence and influence of international conservation designations are apparent in some KBAs. The **Estuario de Virrilá** in Peru has been recognized as a RAMSAR site, indicating its international importance as a wetland, and it benefits from a management framework that includes the support of both municipal and national conservation bodies.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the management of these KBAs reflects a multifaceted approach that integrates governmental oversight, community involvement, scientific research, and international conservation efforts, all aimed at preserving the unique biodiversity and ecological integrity of these South American landscapes."
